# Masterposts – Knowledge Base

This repository serves as a curated and continuously evolving knowledge base, documenting core concepts, tools, and theoretical foundations from my studies and projects in Computer Science, with a focus on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

Each masterpost is a comprehensive markdown document centered around a major subject area.  
They are designed as long-term references, learning logs, and documentation of personal synthesis.

## ✍️ Writing Principles

- Documents are written in **clean academic markdown**, using clear headings and logical structure.
- Code examples are placed in fenced blocks with syntax highlighting (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
- Each post includes:
  - Definitions and core concepts
  - Practical use-cases or implementation notes
  - Links to source material (papers, docs, RFCs, etc.)
  - Personal reflections or learning outcomes where relevant

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository is part of a broader public research portfolio.  
It serves as a **transparent record of my intellectual development**, a tool for structured review, and an open contribution to other learners and collaborators.
